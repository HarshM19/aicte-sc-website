            Event Description : Marathi Bhasha Samiti in association with VESIT Students’ Club conducted a Rangoli camp for the VESIT Students and staff on October 1, 2022, Amphitheater, from 10:30 AM to 12:30 AM.

            Sanskar Bharti is a National Organization that has preserved the Rangoli Art Form and has trained thousands of Rangoli Artists. In our Institute, we also have a few artists who came together to conduct Rangoli Workshop for Teaching, Non-Teaching Staff, and Students.  Around 50 participants registered for this activity at VESIT. The Rangoli art form training was provided by Dr. Anjali Yeole, Mr. Prasad Godse, and Ms. Rasika Naik. Basic shapes of the Rangoli art form were first introduced and later, participants were encouraged to practice all traditional design patterns on the big arena at the amphitheater. A special arrangement was made by providing colors and Rangoli for all the participants. Dr. Prashant Kanade and Dr. Geeta Ajit were actively involved in the overall coordination of the program. All the staff and students enjoyed this unique activity as an initiative under the SPICE scheme promoted by AICTE.  The program concluded with tea and snacks for all the participants. All the members of Marathi Bhasha Samiti and VESIT SPICE (Students Club) took efforts to make this program a grand success.
